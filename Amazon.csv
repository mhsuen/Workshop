Going down to probably what is 2200 k That's a really warm orange color that allows you to really feel relaxed especially when dim down. And then you can scale that up to somewhere around 4,000 k or something a little more stimulating or if you really need some kind of bright bright color turn all the way up to 6500 k. I love that aspect about this bulbs and that's the best thing about them.
Now it's dive into why this only gets three stars. first I almost want to give this 1 and 1/2 stars for the false advertising. this does not work with the Google Assistant which is stated in this Amazon listing as well as printed on the box. It does not work with the Google Assistant. It only works with the Google home. Only way that this works with the Google Assistant is to get the Philips hub. Anyone that's buying the Bluetooth is buying it because I don't want the hub. so if I could give this two and a half stars I would because I don't like false advertising and I bought these because I wanted it to work with my Google Assistant and not have to get the hub.
Second multiple user setup is very complicated even for someone like me running my own tech company setting up advanced networks. there's conflicting information out there and I actually had to call Phillips to figure this out because even he had to ask an advanced tech because they had conflicted information in the office.
To summarize, this is a subpar beta product that should never have been released to the public. Don't advertise that it works with something when it doesn't. and for the price of these bulbs it better work with the Google Assistant and have much more seamless setup. That said, everything is in context and then the smart light world there isn't anything great yet so this is why I bumped it up to three stars and because I really do like the color and the lighting and that's where Phillip's really does come through"

First, you have to ignore the directions that came with the bulb. They were useless and misleading and one of the reasons I've been up half the night. No, you do not need a pricey Hue hub. You don't need the google playstore or the Apple store to download an app. You don't need to select ""Hue"" from the Alexa Skills menu and you don't need to sign up for a Hue account.
All you do is set up your Echo Dot if not already done. You should probably wait while it connects to your other devices. Then screw in the lightbulb and turn on the lamp/light fixture. At this point, Alexa should say new light found, but it didn't. I had to say ""Alexa discover devices"" Alexa named the device ""First Light"" Then I was able to say turn on first light, turn off first light, dim first light. There is a video on this page that tells you the exact same thing. This is the video to follow. I just wish there had been directions with this lightbulb that said how to hook it up with an Alexa device and I hadn't wasted hours of my time."

Ordered replacements. Got everything connected and thought everything was good; was willing to chalk it up to bad luck with defective bulbs. Two weeks later, same problem. Suddenly stopped responding to the google home mini. I disconnected and reset everything (as the troubleshoot guides suggested) and now they can’t even be found again. Exactly the same as before except this time it took one extra week for them to stop working. Even if I can get the reconnect, I refuse to keeping going though this on a regular basis just to use.
Original Review: Huge waste of money. Way too difficult to set up and then even after finally getting them set up, they stopped responding to my Google Home Mini after about a week. Disconnected them to try and reset, now they won’t connect again. Probably going to send them back. Way more trouble than they’re worth.
That being said, the week they worked was pretty cool. Nice and bright at full blast but also dimmable; though the dimmest setting could be a a bit dimmer still in my opinion. I liked being able to control it with my voice and set the “gentle wake” mode that slowly increased the brightness in the morning before my alarm. If only they had worked for more than a week."

They've worked ok and rules are easy to set up BUT, like any other smart plug, WeMo requires users to manage smart plugs using the WeMo app. The WeMo smart plugs were relatively easy to set up with Alexa, however, the moment there was a power outage, reboot of router, etc. they have been a royal pain to get back online.
I received my new Amazon Smart Plug today and the setup was very easy and took minimal time. This was so much easier dealing with one single app (Alexa) that I will now be replacing all of my WeMo devices. I would have given it 5 stars but using the scheduling option (days and times) in Alexa required too many steps. Users should ideally be able to add start times, stop times and days when creating a schedule versus creating separate schedules for start and stop times. Perhaps a lower price would be good. Not just because I want a less expensive product but more importantly, many people have already invested a lot of money with their current smart plugs. For example, over the past years I've added (7) WeMo plugs at an average cost of $30 each and $210 for all (7). Personally, I think it would be a wise decision for Amazon to drop their price so that they can win over customers like me at a faster rate."

Often I will just prepare one if I have time, but this time my personal extraordinary experience with Sengled Tech Support Compelled me to write this.
Yesterday, I installed this product but ran into problems which ended up being related to a combination of my home light dimmer and switch controls, size/construction of home (Concrete floors/walls/ceiling) related to the theater. Mr. Le'varr Welch from tech support handled my call, reviewed my email, diagnosed and followed up with advice and followed up again to walk me through resetting the bulbs until I got the hang of it. Then he followed up about 30mins later to confirm that Everything was working excellently! Finest tech support I have ever experienced (perhaps tied with Sonos).
As far as the product goes... it is outstanding and exceeded my expectations, especially becuase I have been trying to get my neighbors Phillips Hue to work with Alexa and IFTTT. My Sengled once installed just simply worked the 1st time.
Outstanding and Mr. Welch be sure to let your management know that because of you specifically, I will recommend this product to everyone looking for a nice multi-color LED bulb system. I am bringing a hub/light kit to my daughter this weekend!
WELL DONE!"

1) super easy to install. I did it in all of three minutes. Plug the hub into a powersource and then plug into your router. Download the app, turn on the lights, and you’re good to go
2) you don’t need Alexa/google/ any of those for this to work. I do it directly from the Sengled app. The app is pretty straightforward. I’ve even moved bulbs around to different rooms and created “scenes” which allows you to have preset buttons that turn light bulbs on or off and change color and brightness for each individual bulb. I cannot speak to how well these integrate with other hubs.
3) there are 5 preset “white light” options that are super great and gives you a lot of flexibility in the vibe you wanna set in your room. These are also pretty bright.
4) the color features are awesome. I particularly love that you can achieve “pastel” color options (not pictured because my camera couldn’t pick it up) for softer looks. But the bold colors are great and look dope with my gaming setup
Cons
1) while the “white” lights are pretty bright, some of the “color” options don’t emit as much light. I suppose that’s to to be expected. They still look cool though, and do emit a decent amount of light, but you’re not gonna be doing fine work by these colored lights.
TL;DR: these are super great, easy to install and easy to use. And they look dope. Would recommend."

For everyone saying the app is terrible and doesn't work etc... I don't believe them. The app has given me 0 issues. Do I think the app needs work? Yes, but it does everything it is supposed to do.
Pros:
-CHEAP! I mean I have experience with Phillip Hues and this is so much cheaper.
-App is easy to use and came pre-paired so all I had to do was plug in and setup.
-feels more durable than most eco friendly bulbs.
Cons:
Needs HUB. I mean I understand why but using a hub seems counter intuitive in 2018. Should be able to be used differently.
Seems adding lights may be a pain in the butt.
Been using this now since Friday and very happy. I'm going to see how the automatic timer works tomorrow."

I knocked off a star because the app isn't great. For example, the lights should change color in real time as I drag my finger around the color graph. In reality, the lights only change color after lifting you finger, making it hard to get the exact color you want."

It works consistently both with the app and Alexa. Installation was easy too.
The best feature is that it is more energy efficient than competitive switches. I bought a Leviton switch initially (DW15S-1BZ) and found it disconcerting how warm it was. I bought this TP-Link switch and installed it in another room to compare. This switch is cool to the touch. It uses a little bit of power even when the light is off, but not a noticeable amount. The TP-Link Switch is about 8 degrees warmer than the ambient room temperature. In comparison, the Leviton switch was 20 degrees warmer which is warm enough to notice.
My biggest compliant is that it requires you to push the lower section to both turn it on and off. When you go to turn it on, you expect to be able to push the top. Nothing happens there though (you can't depress it, so you know something's not right). When you push the lower section, it will toggle on/off. It works great, but isn't as intuitive as the Leviton switch which allows you to use the upper/lower section to turn it on/off. Even so, you adapt quickly. I plan to buy more of these despite this shortcoming.
I attached some photos showing temperature measurements on this switch and another one. Both are off. It shows this one is much cooler because it is more energy efficient. Temperatures were taken using a Fluke IR temperature sensor. I also took current and voltage waveforms using a Keithley DMM7510 (see various attached screen hots). I found the power to be about 0.5 W when the switch is off or 1.62 W when the switch is on. This was 3 times less power when the switch was off when compared to the Leviton switch (1.86W whether on or off)"

This camera would work well as a nanny cam or a security camera for your house when you're away. You can also put it outside your house as a light that records activity while you're away or while you're inside.
You can view the footage from basically anywhere, so that's good.
The sound and video quality are good, especially for such a small camera, and it works perfectly.
It also comes with a 16gb sd card, which is perfect because I didn't want to have to buy that separately."

......................................................................................... My Review...................................................................................................
.
.
*** App Comparability, THESE ARE IT!
.
For the price of 1 Philips HUE bulb (+additionally requires a HUE HUB that costs $50 give or take) you get 4 bulbs with more features, no extra equipment necessary, that truly integrates to your home not as a gimmick, but something you will use everyday, here you go..
I'm in IT field, and as a geek; I get my hands on latest tech. Since the first gen of smart bulbs/plugs came out (primitive
applications, hard to setup, not bright-enough); I have seen prices decline with features/reliability/brightness skyrocket!
. . . LED bulbs do have a downside, especially these ( I explain below. . .)
.
.
*** SETUP:
Download/Install a App called ""Life App"" , One by one; App discovers each bulb from within the app (these bulbs only work on 2.4gHz - No worries, if you have Wi-Fi, 99% of you are ready to go, for those who utilize 5gHz spectrum most routers will allow you to run both 2.4/5gHz Wi-Fi at same time.)
I found it to be less confusing, and easier to discover each bulb one by one. In the program you can rename each bulb (example Bedroom, or Dining Room). It took me 10 minutes tops to have all 4 online ready to go!
.
.
*** EASE OF USE:
EASY! You literally can replace your old bulbs with these and not even bother having them on Wi-Fi, or integrate them into smart home setup! By flipping the switch on your wall they come ON/OFF (One can use a switch the old fashion way even when in smart home setup, just be sure to flip the wall switch back ""ON"" position, or they will be offline unresponsive when sending commands through smart-apps/voice commands)
.
.
*** INTEGRATION/COMPARABILITY/APPS
Yeah for ALL!!, Alexa, G00GLE, all voice commands from dimming, color change, white light color temperature, addressing commands to particular room/bulb/group. Life App that is the base app for these bulbs is somewhat feature packed: timer, conditions (such as regional dusk/dawn turn on-off, timer, even can engage bulbs by certain conditions for example ""if the outside temperature goes below or above certain temperature I want the lights to turn ON/OFF/DIM/CHANGE COLOR, you really can set them is so many ways, its almost overwhelming!
!!USE YOUR OWN APP YOU ARE Accustomed TO!! = Once Life App is installed you can use Amazon Alexa app, or G00GLE app
ALSO:
IFTTT, ROKID, Tmall Genie, DingDong, Tecent Xiaowei, DuerOS, Google Fit Data Synchronisation
You can stay in your own preffered Smart app ecosystem and interact with the bulbs any way you wish!
.
.
*** DEPENDABILITY/PERFORMANCE
- - - CONS/DOWNSIDE MENTIONED ABOVE = Inherited problem with LED bulbs, especially with higher Wattage bulbs such as these is the HEAT! When Fully bright, the base gets very hot, not scorching, but significant. Philips HUE may be overpriced, but it is well engineered, heat is dissipated through aluminum radiators keeping entire bulb surface cool. Why does that matter anyway: Any IT expert can tell you that heat is the biggest enemy to computer based components. These bulbs have a micro pc (if you will) with integrated Wi-Fi components, circuitry that allows all these features to work. I suspect with time (Don't think anytime soon) heat will get the better of these bulbs. In the past I bought some 1st Gen. Chinese LED bulbs with similar heating issue, more primitive with less computer components that started failing after 2 years. I suspect these might have the same fate, maybe not, time will tell....
.
.
.
*** IN CONCLUSION = Fantastic price for what you get, not a gimmick, adaptable to each User and App, automation heaven, a mood setter, Eco-friendly, controllable from any device on 2.4 gHz Wi-Fi. Bright, responsive, can be used the old-fashion way. Running a little hot, but nothing to worry about, definetly won't last 20+ years, but then again you will replace them by then with something better. . ."

They are compact and low watt but they are very bright when set to 100%. The bulbs were easy to link to the Smart life app and work great with Alexa. The color options are endless you can pick any color you want. They are all very pretty and easy to set through the app. Lights can also be dimmed which is nice for when watching tv. Very awesome lights."

Super neat! These bulbs work just like smart plugs, except that you gain the ability to dim and change the color of the lights. Too bright in the room? Just ask Alexa to turn them down. I probably won’t be using blue (or other unique colors) in my house, but I do love having the option of asking Alexa to make me feel like I’m at a rave lol. At the end of the day, these are a much better version of smart plugs and I recommend them to anyone looking to add a little more functionality to their lighting."

First smart bulb! Took only moments to pair with the Wifi. App is easily navigated as well. First thing...this is BRIGHT!!!!!!! Awesome that everything is controlled on the app. Perfect for outside lights in my opinion. You can change the colors of the bulbs depending on the holiday! Modes allow you to auto change the colors, flash slightly, etc. Great deal for something you can enjoy year round!"

It is a bright bulb, has an array of colors, and the set up app is really easy to use. Plus, to get it connected you only have to turn it on and off three or four times, far from the excruciatingly intensive reset used for GE's smart bulbs. I used this bulb in a spare bedroom, you can see it fills up the room in the dark, and there's also a shot of my cat lounging in the blue light.
Overall, great value for the price!"

I like the bulbs a lot though. No hub required... Very simple to make any light a smart light."

I really like these lightbulbs. They are very easy to use, use the Smart Life app which I really like because that is something it has in common with almost every other device in the market., And also do exactly what you think they do. For example, in the basic set up you can either very the temperature or the brightness. Then, when you move to the color palette you can just pick a color off the light if you like. Then, when you move to the next screen you can actually choose A changing pattern so that it can come and go according to whatever mood you like sort of a psychedelic type thing. All this functionality straight from the Smart Life app and all Alexa compatible. Very helpful."

They work directly from the smart life's app. And if my phone isn't available I can just manually just click the switch. I like how I can control the lights when away from home too while using my smart phone's cellular data. The colors are amazing. So far I have changed the color from each color of the rainbow plus more. I can even adjust the light's color from light blue to dark blue from light pink to a darker pink and every shade in between. It does that for each color too. Even the white light can be adjusted from dim to super bright and it doesn't hurt my eyes either. I think it's a beautiful bulb. Also, the preset multi scenes allows me to quickly change from popular color modes with a press of a button. The lights can even be on an on/off schedule too , therefore I can have each light turn on/ off at what ever time I set it for. I was able to name each bulb through the app. Example my bulb is named after me and my childrens bulbs are named after them etc."

Though I am satisfied with the Hue system but their high cost was a big factor which pushed me to look for alternate options. After browsing Amazon pages for an hour, I decided to go with this product due to its functionality, cost, and several positive/encouraging reviews. I would say that I am not disappointed at all and very happy on my decision. These bulbs provide the same functionality at almost 1/3 of the cost of Hue. Additionally, I can operate them through Alexa and Apple Watch. Another additional advantage is that they do not need a bridge (a piece of hardware that connects the bulbs with the router) so they are an excellent choice for beginners and can help them save almost $100 for bridge purchase. Connecting them to router is super easy and the app provides step by step instructions. I placed both bulbs above my Kitchen Island to create colorful ambience for night. Since both bulbs are connected to the same switch I had to install them one by one. I first placed only one bulb, connect it to the router, turn it off through App and removed it. Then I placed the second bulb and followed the same procedure. After that I placed both bulbs in the holders and they worked perfectly (Earlier I tried to connect them concurrently which did not work). The ""Smart Life"" App that comes with the bulbs is very elegant and has tons of features. You can pick a color of your choice or pick from predesigned color schemes. You may also design your own schemes (which I did). Connecting them to Alexa is super easy. Go to bulb settings, click on Alexa icon, enter login credentials, and that's it. Just make sure that you give a unique name to each bulb (or create a unique group). Overall, I am very pleased with their performance and planning to buy few more for my living room."

This is my second set of lumiman smart light bulb and I must say I love them! We have had the first set for about 6 months. When I saw they now have a four pack, I was excited to buy more.
The best part of the lights is that they easily work with your smart device via an app. The app lets you create different “devices” so you can use the light bulbs singular or pair them together. You can ask Alexa to turn on “light one” or the entire room. There are also cute pre-set colors like Christmas. You can literally choose any shade of color and dimness/brightness you want.
Another great thing about the app is that you can set schedule for automatic times / an alarm type function."

Do NOT use the suggested PlusMinus app. It just doesn't work (or if it does, it's not worth the hassle of conquering). The interface is a garbled mess that can't overcome the ""English as a second language""-nature of it's existence. Use the Smart Life app. Just download said app, then turn the light you wish to pair on and off x5. It will start to blink quickly. Then select ""add device"" in the Smart Life app. It should quickly recognize the bulb. It will allow you to rename it and will automatically sync with Alexa (which will send you a notification stating as much). Another minor gripe is that I had to manually enter both my wifi name AND password with each bulb.
2. Do NOT attempt to use these in a dimmable light socket. They just don't work. They constantly unpair & malfunction with any adjustment to color or brightness. This was especially hard to swallow as I had purchased these four bulbs for my hallway lights, which are all controlled by a dimmer switch. But I kept them for use in other places around the house.
3. If you have any experience with LIFX bulbs and their native app, I would tamp down your expectations regarding these LUMIMANs. They are much dimmer (as the specs tell), but especially so when colors are used instead of whites. Still, at four bulbs for the price of one LIFX, these are an amazing deal for many locations like hallways and bedside lamps.
***Subtracting two stars: 1. No warning regarding dimmer-switch incompatibility. 2. Non-functioning native app interface. 3. it shouldn't take over an hour of work to pair a few lightbulbs to the wifi 4. When you DO download the native app, you're automatically signed up for junk email***"

I have had this smart bulb for around 6 months now and it has been more consistent then some of the more expensive versions. I went ahead and bought the 4 pack and converted my room to all of these. It is for a bedroom so I enjoy the ability to adjust brightness and color for different needs. I like to dim them and warm the temperature a little bit when watching a movie etc.
The old application was a little difficult, but since the update it is seamless. It integrates perfectly with Alexa as well."

These are the best light bulbs I have ever purchased! They not only change to the basic colors (shown in the video) but you can custom set a color your self! You can set them all as one color or individual colors and you can also set them to blink at different speeds. All you need is WiFi and a phone to control them! You can also control them separately or all together. After setting them up, I thought you could only turn them off with my phone or they would have to be reset but we ended up without electricity for about an hour and when they came back on the bulbs were still set on the yellowish green color we had them set to. I’m so excited about finding these, I plan to purchase at least 4 more box’s. Great product at a reasonable cost. I’ve already been showing them off and recommending them to friends and family!!"

What a great buy! We've set it up to work with Alexa and my daughter has fun watching it change colors.
PROS
Smart bulb that works easily with Alexa and has it's own app.
Very bright. (And also brightness is one thing you can adjust on the app.)
Fun, vivid colors.
Pre-set modes for various things like night, reading, meeting, leisure, colorful, etc.
CONS
Confusing instructions. I actually got stuck and couldn't figured it out based on what the instructions said so then I just ditched them and it was way easier than the instructions made it out to be."

These light bulbs are the coolest thing in the world. I just discovering app controlled lights. I bought the two pack so I could have one in my daughter's bedroom and playroom. In her bedroom I keep it in pink and low saturation so it's not too bright to keep her up but bright enough to see her in the middle of the night when I check on her. I like the one in the playroom because on late nights when I need to take her in there due to her not sleeping and her dad being on nights I can turn it off and on with my phone rather than having to walk in the dark to get to the switch. It's got so many color options plus you can turn the saturation up and down as well as the brightness. Everything is controlled from your phone absolutely love love love these bulbs. Wishing I'd have bought the 4 pack. Also they have a regular white colored bulb like your traditional light setting as well."

With my recent interest in Home automation, I wanted to replace all my traditional bulbs with smart led bulbs. Though there are plenty out in the market, I wanted to buy this as it is soft white and not bright white (from other brands) and 60W equivalent. What particularly mind blowing was that an option to adjust the color saturation which was missing in other brands I tried. I got the 4 pack one and that's worth the money. Instead of spending 30+$ on a smart switch socket, i got 4 bulbs and all goes into different rooms. Buying smart plugs would have costed me more and also limited to socket type floor lighting and not the ceiling lights.
This product is of great value and is compatible with 220V as well. Can't wait to test it on 220V."

They've worked ok and rules are easy to set up BUT, like any other smart plug, WeMo requires users to manage smart plugs using the WeMo app. The WeMo smart plugs were relatively easy to set up with Alexa, however, the moment there was a power outage, reboot of router, etc. they have been a royal pain to get back online.
I received my new Amazon Smart Plug today and the setup was very easy and took minimal time. This was so much easier dealing with one single app (Alexa) that I will now be replacing all of my WeMo devices. I would have given it 5 stars but using the scheduling option (days and times) in Alexa required too many steps. Users should ideally be able to add start times, stop times and days when creating a schedule versus creating separate schedules for start and stop times. Perhaps a lower price would be good. Not just because I want a less expensive product but more importantly, many people have already invested a lot of money with their current smart plugs. For example, over the past years I've added (7) WeMo plugs at an average cost of $30 each and $210 for all (7). Personally, I think it would be a wise decision for Amazon to drop their price so that they can win over customers like me at a faster rate."

In trying to set up the second, it kept reverting back to my 5G and it took me another 1/2 hour to figure out how to forget the network settings in Alexa. I had to completely forget all the networks and reset everything several times. I FINALLY managed to get them working."

In addition, I installed them above the cabinets, inside the corner glass cabinet, behind the rangetop, and under inside the island so it would glow through the marble. It ended up costing half what a 3rd party estimated to “install basic LED under cabinet lighting” and delivers much more. The lights can be easily set to create different “scenes” through the app where it can be simple whites or set like a sunset (where each LED strip has a different color of the scene) or even slight flickering like candlelight. Or we even changed it to “batman”-like colors for my son’s 5th birthday. In addition, we’ve created schedules so that they change to nightlight late in the evening, then slowly “waken” in the morning, then shut off automatically during the daytime. While there are some opportunities for improvement involving the Hue App (eg ability to delete scenes), those things are minor and will likely be improved through app updates. The installation itself was not difficult and connectivity to the Hue hub was extremely easy and responsive."

I'm a senior and these were super easy to install. Love the fact that I could place the switch anywhere I wanted without worrying about whether the spot was wiring accessible. Love the funky colors! My husband couldn't believe we installed everything ourselves in just a couple of hours. The biggest drawback for me is the fact that I do have a plug and wire showing--something I'd hoped to avoid. But with the cost savings and many other features I wouldn't get with a hard wired system--I can live with the plug and six inches of wire showing--hide it behind a coffee pot!

Only reason it isn't perfect is because the adhesive kinda sucks tbh. Other than that this thing is cool especially with 3rd party software. Wish the lights stayed the same color you set then to last, when you turn them on. Phillips hue needs some software work for pc/TV integration like they advertise. Other than that it's a great addiction to the home entertainment system.
Update::
All of a sudden the first quarter of the light strip stays a different color that on the rest. It's annoying and It makes me not want to use them. What do I do?"

This is a horrible design. Most of the cheap ones let you cut every led. They are pricey for what they are. Color wise they are good. But I would not buy them again. Instead I've purchased a Dresden ballast and a cheaper set of leds that can be cut at smaller sizes.
https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00NMSQ4QQ

Price was not really a factor, it was more the 13 inch limitation they impose.
But for 70$ you get 3x the length of phillips and the Dresden ballast allows you to turn it into a smart device.
This would have cost ~160$ for the same length using Hue + extensions."

Here's how
1. Don't cut on the dotted line, instead cut through the center of the solder points right next to the dotted cut line.
2. Strip and tin your ribbon wire with solder and connect each wire to each one of the solder points on the lightstrip (you will need to strip back some of the rubber covering on the lightstrips itself) make sure you connect the same color wires to the same solder points on the next section of your lightstrip. If you get the order wrong this hack will not work
3. Cover your work with electrical tape and you're done.
Creating blackout strips like this is a great solve for under cabinet lighting. Good luck!"

These are soooooo much better, more responsive, can go much lower in brightness (and infinitely more color control), can be easily chained together, and even synced up with other strips. I have two strips (with extensions), reaching about 45 feet around my bedroom crown, and have zero issues (aside from the cost).
Love the ease of connection, the quality of the LEDs, and the color control! Keep it up Philips, but lower your blasted prices...
In the image, the 2nd gen ones are up top (crown) and the older first gen strip is under my bed. Huge difference in light quality (which I definitely notice as an artist/photographer)!"

First thing the packaging was great! It comes with 2 light bulbs and with mini booklet manual for setting up. Even the box has instructions too! So its easy to follow.
Second you’ll have to sign up at the app called smart life. Even on the app it also give you detailed with photo/diagram on how to set up.
Normally for smart bulbs its always a hard to set up. But for this one its just easy as 123. Even setting it up with alexa was easy!
Lastly the price!! Normally for just a single smart bulb it would cost you more than $20 if you wanted the ones with quality. I’d say this one for $24 plus tax it was worth it. It comes with 2 bulbs! It has quality! Its like they selling this is 1 package as buy 1 take 1 free! 2bulbs for $24 with quality!! Here it is guys!!!"

These lights are awesome. Integrating them with Alexa on the Echo Dot was very easy. The rainbow scene that starts the video is a preset controlled by the SmartLife app. I have not tried to make the SmartLife preset scenes work with Alexa, but the video demonstrates switching to solid colors, lowering the brightness, and turning the power off through it. My kids love being able to swap the colors in their bedrooms. Having an Alexa device is not really necessary since the SmartLife app gives you enough options for automation, such as preset or custom scenes, preset or custom color/brightness, and automatic on/off scheduling abilities. Definitely worth the purchase."

Once that happened the app recognized both of them and added them. I was even able to add smart life to the alexa app so it recognizes the devices as well. Once recognized the lights give you many options; you can change the colors, make flashing effects, sequences etc. You can even put timers on the lights and have them react to certain things. My favorite feature is that i can add them to siri and create the phrase to turn them off and on. For the lighting itself; the lights are very bright and vibrant!

Secondly, I love the color options! So many colors to manually choose from and several are present.
Then I downloaded and EASILY connected to Alexa! This is going to be so nice to just say, alexa, turn light to blue, turn light to warm white

I bought these lights for my daughter's room. She immediately fell in love with them. The bulb is very bright (both for white and colors) but is dimmable as needed. The connection to ""Alexa"" is seamless as well. The two things I love the most about these bulbs are:
1) The ease of set up. You install the bulb, turn the light on and follow instruction on your phone. Very easy and quick process (less than a minute)
2) The phone application is great. You can control all lights from your phone and give access to others in the home as well."

I love the fact that they change color from my phone or from my google home. Dim the lights or brighten the lights all from your phone or google home. I would go in my bed get comfy, be in my phone read etc and tell google to turn off the lights when i am ready for bed. Dont need to get up or anything. Perfect for anybody. I have one in my daughter room who is 10 she is so scared of sleeping with the lights off. So an hour after her bedtime i would have it programmed to turn off. Great product!"

Jackson","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEO3CZ4KPIA3I47EADFS43KVFX2A/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","First of all, the control app for this company's devices is great. I don't have a lot of experience with smart home devices in general, but I had no trouble at all setting up these bulbs and the interface is very intuitive. I was playing around with them using my phone within 5 minutes of opening the box. It interfaces easily with Google Home, with only a small degree of lag time, so I was also able to issue voice commands relatively quickly. I like when I don't have to fight with technology, and I definitely did not have to fight any step of the way with these light bulbs.
The light bulbs themselves have two settings, ""white mode"" and ""color mode."" The default when you set it up is white mode, and they are VERY bright bulbs, maybe equivalent to 100W incandescent, so if you're an idiot like me and you are looking at it when you flip the switch, it can be a somewhat jarring experience. One thing to note up front is that ""color mode"" is about half as bright, maybe equivalent to a 60W bulb. The first time I switched from ""white"" to ""color"" I was a bit surprised by how much dimmer it seemed in comparison.
""White mode"" only has a single slider for brightness. This is, I suppose, to be expected. The color temperature is highly on the blue end, so the light is very artificial and institutional feeling, like overhead fluorescent tubes at a hospital. I like to use bulbs like this in rooms I need a lot of light, like the kitchen. Most of the time though I strongly prefer ""soft"" white to ""daylight,"" and so it would be really nice if there was a way to switch between soft and daylight, or have a color temperature slide from 3000K to 5000K. Something which would temper the harshness. Of course, this is just my opinion; many people might strongly prefer ""daylight"" style light. The brightness slide reduces the brightness down to perhaps a 20W bulb equivalent amount of light, but doesn't change the overall color much; it's still very bright white even at dim settings.
The ""color mode"" I had a lot more fun with. As I mentioned, it's not nearly as bright as the white mode, which for me was a plus. The color selector is the form of a ring which covers just about any color possible. Obviously the color of the bulb doesn't match the color on the wheel, but you can get a very broad variety. There is also a saturation slider which gives you even more options. So in concert with my comment above about the white mode being too bright, I usually find a nice color of yellow and slide the saturation down to get more akin to candlelight, and it works nice in a floor lamp. Color mode though is obviously for accent lighting, it's not bright enough to reasonably expect to light a room unless you've got multiples.
Given that most overhead light fixtures have sockets for two (or more) bulbs, the utility of these bulbs is limited, unless you want to ""temper"" the light in the room with a complimentary color (for instance). They are really much better for table, floor, and accent lights with a single socket. In this application, the color mode is a lot more fun, and you have a lot more options with how you light your room. I can already envision applications for having different kinds of ambient light for watching movies, playing games, reading, etc.
There is a third feature associated with these, which allow you to create programs, as well as having a few preset color-changing programs, but I haven't played around with it at all. I can't exactly envision a use for this feature for myself, so I can't opine on them too much.
Overall though these things are a GREAT value, and have a LOT of features. I would hope that they'd be able to fit in a color temperature feature for ""white mode"" with a latter software update, but that'd be the difference between a 4 star and a 5 star product as far as I'm concerned."

At first, I thought of these as more of a gimmick so I could control lights with my Google Home and change colors. But, now that I have tried these out, I see it is much more practical than I expected. If we are entering a room, I tell Google to turn on the lights. If we are about to watch a moving, I tell Google to dim the lights or, even more often, change the color to a more ambient one. This started out as an experiment but I will be using these more and more."

This comes with 2 bulbs, so I gave one to a friend so I could get more insight. To start, I'll say he loves it.
$30 for two bulbs is a great price especially considering you don't need a hub or anything silly like that. Just screw the bulb in, install the app, make an account, do the under 2 minute setup, and you're good to go. the Smart Life app seems pretty good in how it handles things. You can control lights in groups or individually, and you can control more than just these lights, if you have anything else ""smart"" like an AC or power outlets.
This all works fine with okay google, siri, and alexa. You can control the color and brightness, but that brings me to my one and only con.
In color mode, the colors aren't anywhere near as bright. In white mode, you can dim from 1% to 100%, 1% is still pretty bright and I'd say even brighter than 100% in color mode. 100% in white mode is very powerful. Nothing I can figure out lets me get a bright color, all the colors are dim. I'm hoping there will be some kind of update maybe with the app? I have a feeling it's a hardware issue, but if this gets updated I'll remove this section from my review and bring it up to 5 stars.
You don't have to be on the same wifi network, as long as your bulb is connected to wifi you can control it from wherever. This is useful for if you're away from home, or wanna mess with anyone who is at home.
Okay google control is great, it understands you contextually, and you can see in my video that I pushed it (pushed google, not the bulb) when I say ""make it red"" it understands what I mean, but when I say ""nevermind, make it blue"" it doesn't get it. Okay google controls are 10/10 as you dont even gotta open the smart life app. You can say turn the light on, lower the brightness, lower the brightness to 20%, make the light green, it all works.
Pros?
2 for $30, no hub required.
Easy setup, easy control.
Consistent and reliable.
Cons?
Colors are very dim, nowhere near as bright as white mode.
I know I gave it 4 stars, but that's because I can't in good conscience give it 5 til the color brightness is solved.
If I could give it a 4.5 I absolutely would. So don't let 4 stars deter you, I recommend these highly, and definitely enjoy having them."

I bought 2 of the 2nd Gen recently to control bedroom ceiling fans. Overall I like the new look. It's a little sleeker and a nice change. The LED indicator is brighter, but at least in my case the switches in both rooms are positioned where the brightness doesn't matter. My only complaint about the 2nd Gen switches was the install. These new ones really, really, really want to work with HomeKit. Unfortunately I don't want to use HomeKit, not for setup or use in general. Both switches were broadcasting a WiFi signal that wanted my phone to set it up via HomeKit only, they would be listed way at the bottom beneath the normal WiFi signals. Click on it, and the phone would try to download and then setup HomeKit before ever letting you connect the switch. Since I didn't want to use the switches with a new app or mess with HomeKit at all, it was a pain to get past this step. Eventually I found out that if the switch sits long enough (about 20 minutes), it'll start broadcasting regular WiFi. Once it's switched to regular WiFi you can then just use the Wemo app to set it up like any other normal Wemo device. I like the look of these new switches, but I'm not sure I'd go with the 2nd Gens again just because of the painful setup."

Seriously! I have other wi-fi enabled devices like nest, and none of them have this issue. I'm switching companies since I won't be paying for a second device just because I installed a couple $40 smart switches. After looking at various blogs on the internet, it sounds like they have been promising to fix the problem for 4 years now...and counting. I did my research and I am switching over to Levitron. Kasa also looks like a good alternative, but given that it's a toss up I decided to support a US company."

At first, I was quite frustrated with Wemo - connectivity was always problematic. Devices kept dropping out, and then dropping back in, with no real detectable pattern. This was particularly an issue when I was not home - using the Wemo app via cellular connection was a form of Russian Roulette.
I then performed an already-planned upgrade to my entire local-area network (LAN). After updating/upgrading my LAN and WiFi hardware, I have found that the Wemo devices are now rock-steady, even when accessing them while on the road. I can only conclude that my WiFi network was to blame.
My original LAN had an eight-year-old DOCSIS 2.0 modem, and a similarly aged 10/100/1000 router. From the router, I ran three small six-year-old b/g/n access points throughout my house - it was the only way I could get enough signal strength in every room.
My new LAN has a DOCSIS 3.1 modem, a gigabit router (with its WiFi function disabled), and a single n/ac three-band 1.6 Gbit WiFi access point that puts out enough signal to cover the whole house (the access point has six antennas!).
As stated, after switching all of the Wemo devices over to a ""modern"" WiFi network, the Wemo switches and outlets have worked flawlessly.
In messing with the Wemo devices, here are some lessons I have learned:
1) Use a single WiFi router (or access point) that puts out lots of signal.
2) After installing all of your devices, uninstall and then re-install the Wemo app on your phone. This clears any old settings and/or cache values that may create conflicts. Uninstalling/re-installing seems to work better at ""clearing the table"" than just clearing cache and data in the app manager.
3) Specific to the switches (the device reviewed here): The reset button is a little depressable bar located under and at the bottom of the ""regular"" (on/off) button. To install the switch on your WiFi network, depress this reset button long enough such that you'll see the indicator LED on the on/off button cycle through all of the available colors (starting with red, switching to white, then blue, then finally red again). When the LED is flashing red, let go, and then wait for the LED to start flashing blue. This can take up to ~ 45 secs to execute. When the LED is flashing blue, the device is ready for pairing with your WiFi network (Wemo's own instructions regarding this process are rather nebulous)."

I bought 2 single pole switches first that have worked without error for a few months now and I can't imagine not having them. My kids leave the lights on no matter how many times I tell them to turn them off. So now I can see if my daughter left the light on in the kitchen or garage from my bed. This 3 way switch is basically two 3way switches in 1. You only have to change one switch (though you may need to rewire the ""dumb"" switch). I am not an electrician so I consulted the manual along with a few you tube videos for help explaining the basics of home wiring. I'm thinking about getting the outdoor switch next for my patio lef lights. This brand is far cheaper than the others but still has a high quality feel. The Smartlife app to connect to my Google home is great a I use it for many other plugs and switches. I like these too because they don't have a logo on it and it comes with a pretty snazy looking screwless wall plate cover. Overall the this switch is a Treat for my Life. (Note the switch looks different than the single pole but they are similar in that they are both white and lack an ugly logo.)"

I used 2 of these to set up my Airbnb apartment and am loving it. I can be OCD at times, and having multiple 3 way switches on one same outlet, sometimes the toggles end up up, down, up. Without going downstairs and figuring out which to flip such that all the switches by the door were all up or down.

Once you have smart switches you can't go back! So I decided to add a 3 way switch to my kitchen lights. I thought the 3-way switch would be more difficult to install but it was just as easy.
Installation: Do make sure you have the right tools and take all necessary safety precautions. Of course if you are uncomfortable doing it definitely ask a handy friend first.
Tip 1: It helps to understand how a 3-way switch works before attempting installation. There are many youtube videos on the topic.
Tip 2: The twister wire connectors in the kit may be too small for your wires especially the neutrals. Just get an assorted pack from Lowes for $3.
Syncing with your phone : Again super easy. Instructions were very clear.
1. Download the Smart Life app and press the ""+"" then choose switch/wifi.
2. Hold down the button for about 5 seconds until the little light stays blinking red.
3. Enter your wifi password when prompted. Once the syncing process is done you are ready to be the king of your domain!
4. After you've successfully added the switch to your Smart Life app, go to your Google home app and link up Smart Life with Google home, then all the switches will show up in Google and be controlled by ok Google commands.
Cons
1. As some other reviewers have commented, the hardest part about the installation is fitting all the wires behind the box. Instead of trying to shove them all in with force, be patient and take your time to fold the wires gently to fit in place.
2. The face plate that comes with the kit doesn't really go with all the other plates you can get at Lowes or Home Depot.
Summary: good product for the price, and easy to use. Will update with use."

I was a little skeptical at first.
I bought a normal switch, installed it, connected it, added it to Alexa, set up an Alexa routine, and asked Alexa to turn it on and off. It all worked seamlessly. While you do have to add the TreatLife ""Smart Life"" app, it's better than many of the other home automation apps I've seen. Plus, Alexa finds the devices with little trouble, and the connectivity between Alexa and the Smart Life is robust.
I ended up buying 2 3-way switches, 5 standard switches and 1 dimmer switch. All of them work great.
ADVICE: Installation of the 3-way switch can be a bit of a trick. The translation of traveler wires to the original switch configuration can give you a bit of trouble. If you have trouble, I recommend consulting an electrician."

1) Kasa control app and all the features it brings.
2) White is true white because of dedicated white leds in addition to the RGB elements. White on other strips is more like 'simulated white'
3) Bright AF. The dedicated white leds make the strip brighter as they are on to varying amounts for all but the very edges of the color wheel.
Bummers
1) You cannot create you own effects nor can you configure segments individually as the marketing info says. You get 10 ""predefined effects"" only, of which maybe 3 are interesting or useful to me. Other strips can't do this either, but they also don't claim to be able to. Expectation fails cost stars.
2) There are not as many intensity levels as other strips, making transitions more stroboscopic and less fluid.
3) **EDIT** this one is now solved. You can buy the extensions. The strip extensions are not available despite the public release info (including a part number, even). I want to put these under upper cabinets... that are 12 feet long. Can only get 6 feet lit up currently. Where are the extensions?
4) The price is bonkers. Congrats to TPLink for my kasa addiction, where rational choices are just a distraction."

My original review was for five stars, but I deducted three due to poor performance and terrible customer service from TP-Link.
I bought four bulbs and loved them for the first three months. One of them randomly stopped working for no reason (while the other ones worked just fine). I tried resetting it, following the directions very closely to a T (I consider myself very tech-savvy and was able to install all four of these quickly without fault), and nothing worked. I tried resetting my internet router, I tried resetting all four bulbs multiple times, but ultimately I learned that I had received a defective/poorly designed bulb. One would think this should be an easy fix, however on Amazon I was not given the opportunity to return one, rather I had to contact TP Link customer support to situate this.
Fast forward 30 minutes of hold time, two hours of being bombarded with random questions by the representative (did you try resetting it? can you send video proof that you tried resetting it? was there a power surge? do you ever get nervous? are you single? (lol lil wayne reference there)). After ALL of this, I received an email from a replacement address asking me to send them MORE photos and proof of me resetting it. I am now in the process of doing this and I assume they will make me pay for shipping to ship it back, and they will also take weeks to send me a new one. Ridiculous. Don't waste your time on a product that has a 30% fail rate.
My original review:
These are amazing. Super easy to install, work incredibly with Alexa, and help me save on my electric bill! I ordered four to screw into my ceiling fan. I could have done with two, but with four, my bedroom is incredibly well-lit and is bright enough to mimic a pharmacy's intense lighting with all four lights at 100% on ""white""."

I replaced a pretty expensive 60 watt LED reading light. The brightness of the white spectrum of the TP Link light is similar to my old 60 watt equivalent LED. I like the fact that I can adjust the white spectrum because depending on what I'm reading, some light just works better than others. So that's pretty cool.
What I think is missing, is a wake feature. What I was hoping for was a sunlight simulation. It's possible to set multiple schedules with gradually increasing brightness to simulate this yourself - however, the app makes that pretty cumbersome to achieve. There's no way to group those alarms into one alarm that you can just turn on and off so when there's a holiday, you're going to have to deactivate all of those schedules. Also, the schedule uses the ""quick set"" buttons to set the color and brightness of the schedule, so you have to first alter the quick set button, then make the schedule. It doesn't sound like much, but it's pretty annoying.
Also, I'm a Google Home user. I don't have, or use Alexa so I can't speak to how this works with Alexa. However, with Google Home saying ""Hey Google, turn on my bedroom light"" works along with something like ""Hey Google, turn my Bedroom Orange"". Also, saying ""Hey Google, turn off my bedroom light"" also works. However, saying ""Hey google turn on/off my bedroom light in 5 minutes"" results in the old familiar ""my apologies, I don't understand""."

First - the printed directions are a bit minimal (not unusual for tech products), so some experimentation is needed. The bulb would not install in Quick Mode (EZ Mode), so I used the ""AP Mode."" AP mode requires the iPhone to connect to the bulb's network (SmartLife-XXX). In this mode, the app provides very good step-by-step instructions, and the bulb installed quite easily. The colors are brilliant and varied. We're not big fans of LED lighting because they are so bright as to be glaring. So we aren't looking for red and blue, but rather something than can emulate an incandescent bulb (nearly) These bulbs have a fairly extensive range of ""white,"" and so are a good choice. The bulbs are closer to BR30. They get a bit lost in a BR40 ceiling fixture, and so less light radiates. There seem to be no comparable bulbs in the BR40 size.
I saw a review here on Amazon that explained how a user managed to install multiple bulbs on a single ""dumb"" switch, which is what I'm trying to achieve.

The Teckin Smart Light Bulb is fantastic! To begin with, my setup only took a couple of minutes. I already was using the Smart Life App so all I had to do was put the Bulb into my lamp and select lamps in the app. It instantly connected to the lamp and then automatically linked to my Alexa Echo. All I had to do was edit the name to something that made more since for me. I attached screen captures of the capability of the Smart Life App. There are 3 slide bars that allow you to control Saturation, Brightness, and Flashing Speed. Another screen allows you to customize the color using a wheel, in combination of controlling the Saturation and Brightness. Another screen controls Brightness and Color temperature. Another cool screen has multiple pre-programmed themes that produce some great combinations of lighting effects. You can also program timer settings to operate the bulb at defined times. The Alexa customization controls are not as extensive. I’ve made screen captures of them as well. I attached a short video of the Shine Theme. I highly recommend this bulb; you can use them as standard lighting or really have some fun using the customization features."

These are TRUE 1300 lumen lights which really helps with the color luminescence sag that all smart lights have. All colors are vivid and accurate. Setting up the lights was probably the most efficient I've experienced to date. Great app and very responsive with Google Home. My only complaint is that they didn't have a higher lumen A19 bulb. I went with another company for that, and I already regret it. The other company had a high lumen bulb but the software and response is trash. Once Teckin releases a high output A19 bulb, I'm gonna buy it.
Usually I'm all about the product itself, but shout-out to the customer service. They are quick to respond and somehow maintain their passion to make sure their customers are happy. Really feel like the retention rate on their behalf is high. Can't say that about the other smart light company I just mentioned above. Thank you.
The picture I attached is emphasis on how bright this is. This is taken DURING THE DAY. If you know anything about phone cameras, if something is very bright, their automatic setting compensates for the light to add detail to the focus. My living room roof is white and the sun it out. Cmon now. Brighttttttt."

Hire a professional electrician if you aren't comfortable around high voltage electrical lines. ---
Having said that, I felt it was easy to install and the directions couldn't have been more simple. This switch requires 4 lines: Line, Load, Ground, and Neutral. It requires all 4 lines to work correctly, so make sure your switch has those four lines. I turned off the power at the circuit breaker area and tested it with a multimeter to confirm that the line wasn't hot. I took my time in reading the directions several times before even removing the cover to my current ""dumb"" switch. From there, I connected the lines as shown in the instruction manual. I was eventually able to stuff all the excess wiring along with the switch back into the socket and seal everything back up.
The next step after that is to install the app, ""Smart LIfe,"" from either app store or google playstore. It was pretty simple from this point on.
It was really easy to use. All in all, I think it's really well made and worth it. I'm very happy with this item."

I often forget to turn off the light, and when I think of it, I'm too lazy to get up. After I change this, it's super convenient. I can turn on and off the light anytime and anywhere outside, which is easy to use and easy to change."

To connect the LED strip to the controller you make sure the LED side of the strip is facing the same direction as the button on the controller. If you get it backwards it will light up weird. If that happens just flip the connection and you should be all good. The LED strip uses 2.4ghz WiFi (Not compatible with 5ghz). Once connected to the Gosund app you can then connect it to your Google Assistant or Home speakers, or your Amazon Alexa smart speakers to control the LED strip with your voice. You can turn them on and off, change the color and the brightness of the LED strip with your voice. The app gives you some additional options such as pre-programmed color scenes and music mode. Music mode uses a mic in the controller to change the color and flash the LED lights. To exit Music Mode you just change the color of the LED strip. The app also gives you a schedule option, where you can have the strip turn on and off based on the time (The timer accuracy is +- 30 seconds). The color can not be set for the timer, it uses the color that you last had it on. This LED strip defaults to on when it is powered off then back on. Which is perfect for behind your TV. You can also use this LED strip to light up your 3D Printer and any other small area you want."

These came in a small box with instructions, roll of lights (9.2 ft), usb control box and extra adhesive strips. The lights have 3M adhesive on the back to stick whatever you want. I found the middle of the strip and wrapped it around a small edge I found on my TV. Worked perfectly.
Connecting to the wifi was easy. Just make sure your phone (or tablet) is using 2G (not 5G) wifi connection. I was able to use Smart Life app, which I was using for my other automated devices, to connect to the light strip. My Amazon Echo Dot automatically found the device and I was able to control it with Alexa voice commands.
Overall this has been exactly what I expected. The features all work as advertised."

I almost gave up and was going to return the item.
Thankfully I’m pretty stubborn and kept trying and somehow got them blinking by unplugging the usb and replugging it in but I could see someone who gets easily frustrated or gives up this might be a huge issue (so do not gift this product to someone like that...)
It works once it connects and works well with google home. The lights are bright and can dim and change a variety of colors... some features like the music stobe to music/sound only work through the devices app as far as I can tell."

That’s because I have several lights controlled in two locations by 3-way switches and I thought it either wasn’t possible or would have cost a lot of money to replace them all. I love the fact that You only need to use one smart switch paired with a normal switch to get 3-way control. That’s a real money saver since the four pack was plenty enough to cover all the 3-way lights in my home.
The directions were clear and they were really easy to install. The first one took a bit of learning to figure out the wires in my existing switch, but that’s only because I wasn’t sure if my wiring matched the instructions. After I figured it out the rest were a breeze to install.
As far as aesthetics they look really clean when installed with the wall plate it comes with. I think they look better than the Wemo and Lutron Casetta switches that I also have in my home. The design and build quality are excellent, exhibited by care and thought you see in high end products that was put into these switches from the pre-tinned wires, protective films coverings, wire labels, and packaging just to name a few.
When it comes to functionality there’s not much to say other than it works and works really well. The Smartlife app is great and useful but I mainly bought the switches for the Amazon Alexa integration. Adding the Alexa skill was easy and fast. They default as switches in the Alexa app but it was easy enough to change the type to a light so all of my lights can be turned on or off at once. Each time I installed a new switch, they came up immediately in Alexa without having to manually search for new devices.
I like these switches better than the Wemo switch I have controlling my bedroom lights. For one, they are incredibly cheaper. Two they work with 3-way setups. And three, they don’t radiate heat from the switch like the Wemo does. That means they probably use significantly less power to operate.
Overall I recommend these switches Since they are affordable, functional and elegant."

Replaced every switch in my home. Can't say enough how great these switches are. 21 switches and not one dud yet. I have owned about every major brand of smart switch out there and these smart switches are the best that I've owned. I have not had one single installation or configuration issue yet. I couldn't be happier. Every time I have a glitch on my router or modify the settings, these switches have always automatically reattached themselves to my network without a single issue. Amazing! Everyone loves asking Alexa to switch any light in the whole house. With one command I can turn off every light in my home and with the Smart Life app I can even turn them on or off remotely.
Set up and installation was a breeze. If you have the wiring wrong the lights that you're wiring blink at you to let you know that they are wired wrong. Now that's smart! These switches even self-configure in the Amazon Alexa app once you add the device to the Smart Life app - even with the same name that you give it in Smart Life. Nice!
I highly recommend these smart switches (and have already to my friends and family). They are the best quality for the price out there!"

First off, this package of switches represents the 20th smart switch I have installed into my house. Using the Smart Life app on my phone, getting one of these installed only took 15 minutes. Assuming multiple on the same breaker, doing them all at once, consider about another 10 minutes for each switch.
WiFi Note - These only 'work' on a 2.4Ghz WiFi. What that means is that if you try to configure using your phone which sees the WiFi of 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz and only shows a single name, you will encounter problems if you have 'intra-station' traffic disabled. If you have 'intra-station' traffic enabled (typical default in the USA) and your WiFi use the same name, you shouldn't have any issues. Although a proper WiFi stack on a device *should* work even when both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz use the same name, enough devices don't work right that I no longer recommend that configuration unless you have tested your devices and it is helping you achieve higher speeds.
Back to the switches - These switches are great quality, I haven't had any issues with them. If your house is older than about 1975 in the USA and hasn't been rewired, these aren't the right product for you because a neutral wire is required. Aside from that, turn off the breaker, put the common wire at the top of your existing switch to the common/load terminal of this switch, and connect each of the two travelers (next to each other vertically and on opposite sides of your existing switch). It doesn't matter which traveler is connected to which side, because that is how 3-way switches work."

We also had no way to turn it on if we planned to be home late. This was the cheapest, easiest way for us to solve this problem. All we do now is leave our switch on and don’t worry about it! Not sure if it still draws electric since it is technically sensing light or darkness all the time but at 8 watts I don’t worry."

I was trying to save some electricity by not having them lit all the time, but guess what--coming in and out of the door literally a foot away from the sensor and not having it light up was a serious pain in the tush. Plus, I'm a single female living alone, and I do everything I can to increase my security. Having these bulbs always on when it's dark out is worth it to me. It's always lit up when I come and go at night, which makes dealing with keys and steps and grocery bags and whatever else so much easier and safer. And it turns off during the day when it's not needed without me having to do a thing. No timers, no constantly remembering to flip the switch or cursing because I forgot to turn the light on/off. Easy."

Great idea also to deter people from knowing you're gone all day if you can't be around. A little pricey but good bulbs to have outside."

These are fantastic!! Nice and bright, nice color, come on when it gets dark and stay on until the sunrise. I bought 1 set of 2 for my garage door lights since that light switch is not in a convenient location to use on a regular basis. We put them in and saw them come on at night. They looked so great I immediately went online and bought another set of 2 to replace my front porch lights as well so the light colors match. Highly recommend!
One word of caution -- be very careful which bulbs you are ordering (motion activated bulbs vs the dawn to dusk bulbs). My first order came incorrectly so had to return/replace. It was easy switch but still good to know."

They are dusk-to-dawn, not motion sensing (is this listing offering motion sensing, too?), but they do work outdoors and do work within a few feet of each other, which were all negative issues I had seen on other bulb reviews. We leave the light switches on before we head off to work in the morning, and when we return during these early winter evenings, the lights are bright enough to get from the car to the door with solid visibility. They do not stay lit during daylight. I will definitely buy these again in the future as long as they don't burn out too quickly."

I have successfully installed a single wemo 3 way switch where as the other ""dumb"" switch still works too!
Please see my uploaded photos with this review for proper wiring diagram.
What your missing is that the wemo simply can't replace one or the other in your 3 way setup, it must be replace the switch that has its main hot from your circuit breaker, and then be wired exactly as the diagrams show.
After ordering this product and finding so many negative reviews, I had to understand wemo would not release a 3 way switch just to defeat the manual operation of how 3 way switches work, and low and behold, burried deep in the web, these support diagrams have been found for correct installation.
You are welcome!"
"Wemo Wi-Fi Light Switch 3-Way 2-Pack Bundle - Control Lighting from Anywhere, Easy In-Wall Installation, Works with Alexa, Google Assistant and Apple HomeKit (WLS0403-BDL)","https://www.amazon.com/Wi-Fi-Light-Switch-2-Pack-Bundle/dp/B07NPZVYR1/ref=sr_1_34?keywords=smart+light&qid=1581536083&sr=8-34","77.","https://www.amazon.com/Wi-Fi-Light-Switch-2-Pack-Bundle/dp/B07NPZVYR1/ref=sr_1_34?keywords=smart+light&qid=1581536083&sr=8-34","Clark","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFKLPUCQ4Y4UJBL7PVA4I37HPCEQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","I am thrilled that Wemo finally released a 3-way switch and overall I'm very pleased with the product.
The Good:
- the switch matches the cleaner look of the Wemo Dimmers
- the switch CAN detect if the load/light is on or off (this works even with just one Wemo 3-way switch is on a circuit)
- the switch CAN toggle the lights on an off even when it is connecting (good if there is a power outage)
- the switch is relatively easy to install, but recommend you watch a video on 3-way switches as a primer, fitting all the wires back into the junction boxes usually takes the most time and effort.
Overall, I am super pleased that I can finally turn on and off all the lights in my entire house via Wemo app, Alexa, and/or HomeKit. However, I still can not control the dimming of any light in my house that required a 3-way dimmer, which are all of my entryway lights and hallways. I would love to see a Wemo 3-way Dimmer in the near future in addition to a Wemo-4 way switch. Lastly, LED light owners, who have 3-way Dimmers connected to a 3-way switch might encounter their lights flickering after switching to the Wemo 3-way, due to less resistance. I can not fault Wemo for this because it's an Industry issue, just heads up that you might need to upgrade your manual 3-way dimmers to a LED friendly version if your LED lights start to flicker after the upgrade."

Those work great - I have 6 of them in my house. I was excited when WEMO offered the 3-day light switch. However, my experience with the new 3-Way light switch was a complete disappointment. I got it installed per the instruments, but the darn thing keeps losing WIFI connectivity and resetting. I tried moving the switch to a different outlet (closer to WIFI), but still no luck. I keep hearing a clicking sound and I would lose connectivity to the wall switch. This thing is definitely buggy."

I’m no electrician but installation was fairly easy. You need some luck and pushing to fit all the cables and wire connectors inside the box if you are changing a double switch. Connecting to the Wemo app and google assistant was easy too. However my new 3way Wemo switch won’t connect to the apple home and worst... I found out that if the light is turned off by the other switch, then the Wemo switch is useless. I thought the whole point of being 3way is to be able to control the light no matter what position the other switch is. Very dissapointed in this. Gave it 3 stars only due to cool updated front look and round edges in the plate."

It is incredibly annoying that I have to switch WiFi networks every time I want to check on the status of my switches. The biggest plus about this particular unit is that it integrated well with Apple Home and (so far) it hasn’t lost the connection to the app.
It is NOT a dimmer (and the Wemo dimmer isn’t compatible with 3-way switch configurations), so I’m planning to install a manual dimmer in another position to let me control the intensity.
Finally, know that the switches will constantly drop out of the app. If you launch the app, many of your Wemo devices may show as not available. You basically have to wait and hope that there’s nothing wrong. This can take anywhere from 2 to 5 minutes."

I just purchased a two-pack and was really impressed how flawlessly it connected to wifi and integrated with both Apple's Home Link and Amazon's Alexa. While it happened virtually seamlessly on Alexa, I had to ""inform"" Home Link about the new addition. You do this by opening the Wemo app and letting it scan the bar code into the home link app. But that part didn't work. So I just did it manually by entering the eight digit number supplied with each device. Pretty simple. The only frustration is installing a relatively large switch into a very crowded space. Trimming wires to a shorter length would have helped, but I'm always afraid of getting them too short, so I just kept everything as supplied, bundled them as best I could, and literally jammed them into the back of the receptacle... pretty much same as the pros do it!"

Installation is easy if you have experience with electrical at all and as long as you have a neutral wire. App is responsive and the switch connected to my Hubitat easily once I sorted out the problem with Apple HomeKit. If you do not have Apple HomeKit and want to set this up using an iOS device make sure you turn off WiFi assist. For some reason if that isn’t disabled my iPhone forces me to try to set it up using HomeKit instead of directly through the WeMo app, and since I don’t have HomeKit set up (or even available) this was a big issue for me. Disabling that allowed setup via the app as expected."

Here are a couple of corrections and updates.
- I had 8 of these installed, not 6
- They randomly changed brightness in both directions (brighter and dimmer)
- After posting this review, I finally heard back from their support; see below for their explanation, which still doesn't make sense to me, seems like a defect
- I've already removed these and replaced them with tp-link smart dimmers, and they work just fine, no changes in brightness, despite the same wiring and bulbs that apparently caused problems for the gosund switches
- Here's their reply: ""Maybe you have misunderstood what I mean. In fact, this problem has only occurred once or twice so far, and it is related to the type of light bulb. This problem has been solved when we change the dimmer switches for the customer and suggest the bulb model. As you know, there are countless bulb models on the market. Hopefully you understand some of the technical bottlenecks.""
I've installed 6 of these in our home. I also have smart light switches installed (lutron caseta, tp-link). I bought these over the Black Friday period as the price was great. But... Now they randomly jump brighter (they don't jump dimmer). Back to ther other brands of smart switches I've installed - they are part of the same alexa routines (turrn on at sunset, etc) and perform just fine. So these Gosund switches are definitely defective. Also, I emailed their tech support, never got a response. Huge pain to remove these and replace them, but my family is frustrated with me for installing these!"

After opening the box it was kind of nice to know there would be no store runs alls I needed was a screwdriver. The push on off button without using the google app or display is a great feature (I mention this because I have been asked it before by friends). It makes it so anyone can still use the switch without having to speak to a speaker. On that note I will say setup on my google app is just as easy as any other smart connected device. I have not had any problems setting timers or a geo fence to turn lights on and off when no adults are home. The dimming function is very easy to use. It's a simple slide up slide down to get the desired effect once the switch is on. I was a little nervous at first because at extreme settings my lights would flicker or not turn on at all. After a little research I realized I had to replace the non dimmable bulbs. I like that I can dim the lights down to almost a night light for the whole room. It makes for easy morning eye adjustments and less of a chance of stepping on a misplaced lego."

Overall the smart bulb behave adequately. The ability to adjust the brightness, saturation and color from a palette wheel is impressive.
Here are some pointers:
- when power is switched off and back on, the bulb will be switched on by default in about 2-3 sec. Does not matter the last state condition of the bulb from the app.
- when power is switched off the app will eventually report the smart bulb as offline after sometime, not immediately.
- no word on the life expectancy but the bulb has a warranty of 12 months.

We have so many Teckin smart lights that I’m running out of places to put them… A good problem to have. 😀
This newest Smart Lightbulb from Teckin features a warmer and colder feature that allows you to have greater control of the mood of a room. As much as I love all the Teckin smart lights the only issue I had was that previous lights could be straining on my eyes. Particularly when I’m working late at night in my office.
Now with the ability to set the lights warmer staring at a computer screen at midnight is not quite so bad. Great job Teckin! 🤓"

I've purchased Philips Hue and have that set up through a hub, so I was intrigued to see how this ""hubless"" product would work.
Set up took under 2 minutes (all you need is 2.4Ghz WiFi and the app) and then you should be underway relatively quickly! I can use my google assistant to turn the light on/off, and have it linked up to my rooms.
Great color wheel and easy to change, responsive to voice changes too (e.g. Hey Google! Change the light to red!)
The bulb is larger than a standard size (it's about 4 inches wide, normal bulbs are around 2.5-3 inches) so make sure your light fitting can handle that!
Definitely a good buy - and fun to have many different colors to set the scene."

Either the controls were wonky, the installation was difficult, the lights weren't bright enough, or they were too expensive for me to completely replace all of my lights. I have used some other products from this manufacturer, and while I was mostly satisfied, they are really starting to earn my praise now. These bulbs are the best overall that I have ever seen, and the price is amazing. The white spectrum range of these is definitely in the 100 watt range of incandescent bulbs. They are very bright and painful to look at directly. The controls are in the Smart Life app, which is reliable and well organized. The setup was easy and there is no bridge to deal with (boo on bridges).
There are two things that keep them from perfection though. While the white light range is super bright, the color range is at around 75 watts equivalent instead of 100. Still very good, but I made a note of that because I'm a nitpicky person about these things. And the floodlight shape is just a little too big to fit most of my lampshades. Still though, I'll buy new lampshade mounts for these puppies because they are so close to perfection that I'm not sure I need to continue looking for it anymore.
One other thing, these guys are offering a free bulb for reviews. Normally that bothers me as I feel that doing that can devalue Amazon's rating system, but this time the product actually deserves good reviews so...I'm getting a free light bulb!"

I got choices of cold, warm and color light. Color mode as well as brightness can be conveniently controlled by the smart app on your phone. Even though says 13W, it’s pretty bright when I set to the max brightness. Wifi and app connection setup was pretty easy and straight forward, just need to follow the instructions and hints. My favorite feature is the voice control part. It’s hooked up with my google home, so instead of turning it on & off via APP, I just need to do voice control. For me I feel like this is so convenient and saves time. The bulb looks great too and you can feel it’s in great quality. If you are looking for a smart bulb with reasonable price, this is the one I highly recommended."

It has an elegant led light on the switch, and it is not a paddle switch. Which is if you have ever tried the paddle switches (i have a house full of GE smart paddle switches) you will not that it is not as simple for your grandma to turn on or off the light. With this switch, if it is off, click it and it is On, click again and it is off.
Installation is very easy and simple, I took videos but amazon is not allowing me to attach it. If you meed help, let me know and I can send the videos to you.
It fits 100% in your gang box, perfect fit, and once connected to the wireless, it works with Alexa without the need of any Hub."

This is my first time making a “how to” video lol. Just wanted to share how easy it is to install these. For the price these cannot be beat. Very easy to install by anyone(I’m definitely no expert). App is easy to use, love the looks and quality of these light switches.
Please make sure you have a neutral wire before ordering otherwise they will not work."

This smart light switch by Treatlife was a great choice for me because I wanted to install it in my garage where it is very dark and sometimes I want to come in from the side door and be able to remotely turn on the light with my smart life app. It also has a light indicator that stays on when the light is turned off which makes it really easy to locate when I want to manually turn on the light switch. The package came with very easy to read and understand instructions on how to properly install it and connect it to my smart life app. It also works great with google assistant which makes using it even easier. The light switch itself is very good looking and so far it has work flawlessly by hand and remotely. I definitely recommend this light switch if you are looking for a nice looking light switch that comes with everything you need to make the install as easy as possible."

I came across ""Smart Light Switch"" from Treatlife and decided to purchase two to test. I was impressed with the quality and easy installation. I am going to purchase few more of this devices and don't have to worry about leaving lights on and wishing to have some remote control over them. The search is over.
Today (a week later) I discovered something even better. I can set the light(s) to come on at sunset and off at sunrise. I will not have to adjust the schedule anymore. It is done for me according to sunset/sunrise for my location. Im getting more of this. My neighbor loves it too."

This is just what I was looking for, a new colored lightbulb I can use in my front door porch light fixture as well as the light by the garage.
I waited to register my smart home app on my phone so by the time I finished that the bulb had quit blinking.
This bulb replaces a bunch of colored light bulbs, most had burned out anyway.
Now I can choose any color or color sequence and or daylight white from my smart phone .
You can put this on a schedule to turn the bulbs on and off at specific times.
Right now I'm running (Rainbow) to go with my outdoor Christmas lights.
This bulb puts out a very bright light.
Wow this product hit the bullseye!
Be advised its best to get your smart app up and have your wifi security code in hand before attempting to connect this product. Definitely with the price. I plan on buying a few more."

Third product I buy from this particular seller. All great! I've bought two sockets (Wi-Fi) and now this smart bulb (lighting Wi-Fi) and they continue to deliver. Great quality. Fast shipping. No issues at all. The smart bulb was very easy to set up. Having just one app (Smart Life) does help a lot as you might find that every other product requires to download a different app...except for these. No delay when changing the colors or settings. It will also give you the option to choose different settings/atmospheres/scenes of colors so you can set the mood for different occasions if you like. I haven't tried it with Alexa because I'm not really into it. Highly recommended."

I like these lights, they are very easy to setup.

These are my first smart bulbs and I'm glad that I've finally got on the smart light train! I downloaded the app - it's not Teckin's app but a universal smart device app that these are made to work with so app problems should be directed to the app maker and here - I was quickly able to set up the bulbs on the app and then link my smart speaker for voice control. I can now control the bulbs - on/off, color and brightness all via voice anywhere in my home or via app from anywhere. The voice control works well. Having multiple colors is a nice added feature."

After only owning Hue lights, I was nervous to try other brands because Hue is known for being the best. However, this product completely blew me away. It's so much better than I expected.
It is very easy to setup and connect to my Google Home ecosystem.
The one thing I did notice is when selecting default colors from inside the google home app, the colors vary slightly between my hue light and this one.
All things being said, for a product that is a third of the cost as hue lights, these lights can't be beat! Will definitely be buying more."

They are easy to install, once done. you need to download app from App Store.
Pairing could be little challenging, but once done, you will enjoy your light.
You can set the temperature warm level and different colors.
with the help of the App, you can change colors as needed/based on your mood.
only disadvantage i see is, you cannot control both bulbs at one time, each bulb has their own pairing mechanism and settings. if you installing at two different locations then you are good. but if you install next to each other, you need to manage both of them separately but not a big deal.
Overall these LED bulbs gives you a fancy look where ever you install them."

I seem to have accumulated a collection of different brands of wifi switches. None of them is bad, but I think this one is the best of the bunch. Let's start with the packaging. It is well packaged with good foam padding to protect the product during shipment. All of the exterior surfaces has a protective plastic material that keeps the switch from getting scratched during installation. The protective material comes off easily after installation. I have not used this switch with the cover plate that it comes with because I used all four switches in double gang applications. I have used the dimmer switch also from Treatlife that I did put in a single gang application. The cover plate click right into the light switch and creates a no screw clean look (see photo). I attached pictures of this installed product in the off and on condition. When off, the product has a round white dot (so you can see it in the dark). There is a slight indentation in the same location as the light is to give you a visual cue that this is where to push to turn it on. Sometimes it is the little things that matter. I like doing my electrical connections with the snap-in connectors. Unfortunately, most of the switches available have stranded wire which makes it impossible to use snap-in connectors. This product uses stranded wire, but they went the extra step of soldering the wire and this makes it possible to use the snap-in connectors. Finally, I have both Alexa and Google Home in my home and connecting this device to either was easy. The video attached shows me controlling the switches with both automation systems.
Are there any cons? My applications are in rooms where I do not sleep, but if light bother you then the small amount of light that the switch emits in the off position might bother you. Its really not bad and it is white not blue like some switches. It would be great if the app allowed this light to be disabled. Second minor point is that the switch is a toggle rather than a rocker type. Getting used to pushing on the bottom of the switch for both on and off might take a couple of days. Of course you can always use your voice to control the device, then it doesn't matter.
Bottom-line, an excellent product."

Not wanting to mix and match several different types and brands together I looked in the product line offered by Treatlife, so far they have filled that need with the four packs and three way switches to cover most homes.
Install and setup went easily, no problems and had it up and running within minutes.
So far I've installed four regular and one three way, all worked perfectly out of the box. As of this writing I've decided to do yet another room and ordered another three way, of course it is a Treatlife brand, why mess with success?"

After researching several different ""Smart Switch"" products, I chose the Treatlife product as it has an excellent review rating and is competitively priced. I also like the look of the switch (specifiically the SS02 model). So I purchased several of these switches (single pole and 3-way versions). They delivered in quality packaging with clear instructions (including images) and necessary components for installation. Took me about 30 minutes to do the first one but after that only 10 minutes for each additional one. This includes connecting to WiFi (using the free ""Smart Life"" app) and linking with my Amazon Echo device (i.e. Alexa) for voice control.
Again, the look and feel of the switch is excellent. The switch has a nice ""press button"" (mouse-like ""click"") way of manually turning it on and off... as opposed to the traditional toggle switch. Also, the built in LED light glows when the switch is off which helps locate it in the dark, and adds a cool ""techy"" look to it.
I will be outfitting my entire home with these switches. I've added some pictures to this review of one of my installs.
Note: The SS02 model is the 3-Way version, and the SS02S is the Single Pole version (slightly less $ than the 3-Way). Only use the 3-Way version for a 3-Way switch configuration."

I have Hue lights and will easily continue to buy this product over the Hue lights. The problem with Hue is that you always have to leave the light switch on for them to work, with this product you’re connecting your smart home directly to the electrical source via a switch.
After my original four pack installation, I quickly bought another two four packs to completely connect the downstairs levels of my home.
If you have ever installed a light switch, then the electrical installation is easy. For the Smart Life installation, simple make sure that you hold the button down for 5 seconds and ensure that the button is flashing red. This sounds easy, but it is not incredibly clear in the app. The first switch took a few tries, then the other switches were a breeze.
If you use an Alexa smart speaker, then go to the Alexa app on your phone, click on Devices, hit the plus sign, and click switches - Alexa will take care of the rest! From here creating Alexa routines are a breeze!
5 Stars worth the purchase!"

First off, I have to say that I really don't like the warm white color light and always have disliked it. So my review of these bulbs is slanted by the fact that the white color isn't tunable to my liking.
The bulbs arrived safely and on time. I ignored the instructions to download yet another app. Each of the four bulbs started flashing immediately and connected to the Tuya ""Smart Life"" app I already had installed on my iPad, even through a closed double-paned glass door to the outside. I didn't have to move the router or iPad closer to get them to connect. Google Home found them in no time as well. If you need instructions, get out your reading glasses because light grey type on white glossy paper isn't a great choice for reading, fashionable though it may look.
The lights worked as smart bulbs do, even in tandem with a smart switch. (First, you have to turn the smart switch on, then the particular bulb.) Scenes from the ""Smart Life"" app worked, except for music, but it may be that there's not enough bass in Debussy for that to function properly.
I had been debating whether to get smart bulbs for my house. I'll probably keep the one on the patio, and I may get a smart daylight (5000K+) bulb for one or two locations, but I'm much more likely to use smart sockets, switches, or outlets with regular LED bulbs. I'll give away the rest to a friend who likes the warm white color. I suppose I just don't need the entertainment value of changing colors except in entertaining areas, when entertaining. With IFTTT integration I may figure out a scenario in which I want bulbs to change color to notify me of something, eventually. I am not opposed to smart technology; I have many smart devices and I see the value, especially as I am aging. Smart devices will enable me to keep my independence much longer. I'm just not convinced, for me, of the value of these particular smart bulbs. On the other hand, if you live with others, you may want to know if they are coming home, or you may want a countdown to turn off your child's light at night, or some other scenario, and if that is the case, smart bulbs may be useful for you. They may also be useful if you live in an apartment and want smart lights without installing new switches.
I was able to get a fairly close approximation of daylight white by changing the color to blue and decreasing the saturation to 4%. Had the white been tunable, I probably would have given the bulbs five stars. It's not the bulbs' fault that AI can't figure out classical music, or that I'm capable of entertaining myself without the lights changing color.

I installed it on the Smart Life App as my other smart sockets were already in that app. It was a quick process. Just make sure you're using 2.4ghz. Linking it to google home and alexa was quick too.
To link Smart Life app to Alexa:
1. Click on the 3 lines on the upper left corner.
2. Click 'Skills and Games'
3. Search for Smart Life App
4. Click enable
5. Login into your smart life account"

I picked these bulbs up to add to my home automation mix. They connected to Alexa via the smart life app easily. I like that I can not only have a very nice white light but I can also change colors. The white light is nice and bright. All from my voice I can: Change colors, dim & brighten, and turn them on & off. The bulb also allows for setting when it will turn on or off itself via a schedule. I do not often add videos to my reviews but I felt these bulbs were so cool I would share some functions with others interested in them. I recommend this item."

I always fight to turn of the light but these lights work great because I can ask Google Home to turn my lights off!
To set up, download the Smart Life app and connect it with Google Home. I am able to get everything up and set up within 10 mins. I love the feature that I can schedule the light to be turn on. It is going to be my new alarm 'clock' in the morning.
I was playing with a few settings, such as changing the colors, the brightness, and different modes like studying or working mode. There is this music mode that will listen to your background music and change the lights based on the tempo of the songs. So it is like a party in my room!
Totally love these products and this would be a great gift for my friends and family!"

The integration with Google Home Assistant was simple and fast. The dimming feature on these LED are handy since you dont need a separate dimming light bulb ballast. Light temperature is also very useful for different times of the day to set the mood in your rooms. Also the smart life app has a great automation feature that allows you to string multiple actions that will execute if certain conditions are met. you can really create some cool automation recipes with it.
Highly recommended product for home automation if you do not have the right electrical lines ran through the walls for smart light switches (they require 4 wires to install properly. some older homes only have 2 wires ran to switches)."

These are great smart bulbs. They were very easy to install using the AP mode or direct connect, through the Tuya smart app. All features and functionality seem to be working properly. They integrate well with Google home. The only drawback I see is that you don't get all of the features like scenes and music reaction in the Google home app. You have to go to the Tuya smart app to use those features. But no big deal to me."

I replaced the bulbs in my bathroom & couldn't be happier. All I had to do was screw them in & open the app, and touch the + button, they added themselves & started working right away. I really like that I was able to group them together so that with one voice command to Alexa I am able to change the lighting for applying makeup. I added them to my ""goodnight Alexa"" routine & now have one dim red nightlight in the bathroom without taking up a plug. In the morning I have them set to gradually increase to full brightness so it's not a shock when I'm half asleep. I also really appreciate that the bulbs are now made from plastic so if I drop one there is no fear of broken glass in the bathroom. All in all another great buy and an easy step in converting my old ""dumb"" house into a smart house without any complicated re-wiring."

I already use some of the Teckin smartbulbs and have been happy with it, I needed some more for the family room and went with Teckin as well. It is fairly easy to setup and the best part is it works with Alexa.
Installation: The installation instruction was pretty straightforward. To be able to connect with Wi-Fi, you need to download a smart life app and the Wi-Fi connection needs to be in 2.4Ghz. I had some issues connecting to 2.4Ghz Wi-Fi but I eventually changed the router setting and was able to connect to Wi-Fi. Once its connected to Wi-Fi, you will be able to use it with Alexa or Google assistant. Once connected you can use voice command and/or automate the light with Alexa app and use it in conjunction with other smart home devices.
For the price and quality, I highly recommend this product."

Some of the major selling points for me are: The East at which I was able to set them up. I already had google assistant. The bulbs come with a manual but it’s as easy as installing the bulb: download the smart life app, click add smart light, flip the switch 3 or 4 times until the bulb starts blinking, connect the bulb to a 2.4 WiFi device and that’s it. Super easy!
The second thing that I like is that you can use google assistant or the smart life app, which is super convenient.
The third thing is that the bulb has multiple features: schedule, which you can use to automate the bulbs to come on and off at a certain time, you can also change the color and color temperature which is really cool.
My one draw back is that sometimes google assistant says the bulb is unavailable even though my internet is connected. Not sure why that is.
I am also big on customer service and Teckin is very customer service oriented. Overall, I would recommend these."

My only question is the longevity, for now they are 5 Stars, if that changes I will update... I just ordered over 28 more to do my whole home or at least where I want control... Great Job TECKIN"

It took me literally 2 minutes to sync the device with the smart life app, which in comparison to other brands was faster. All of that could be due to my experience with these type of devices, but either way I thought it was easy to use. The lights do not need a hub and connect directly to your router via WiFi. If you are wondering if these bulbs are bright don't worry at all. These babies are 1300 lumens which are almost impossible to find with color changing abilities at this price point. The only two negatives I have about the product are color saturation and dimming capabilities. When changing colors the bulbs remain bright but the colors don't quite seem as deep as some of the other bulbs I have. Dimming the lights to 1% also still seems too bright. All in all I would recommend these to anyone for kitchens, or living rooms, but maybe not bedrooms if you do a lot of low light reading. The google assistant integration also falls in line with other brands and is fantastic."

I figured instead of going for the big-name brands, let's give these Teckins a try...boy am I glad I did! They utilize the Smart Life app. I dabbled with it for about an hour and was able to get several cool automations set up. One thing is to turn on cool lighting in the morning at 8am. Then at sunset, switch it to warm lighting. Once 11:30pm hits, turn on a rainbow fade for 1 minute (I like to call this my nightly party mode) Then at 11:31pm, dim lights to about 15%. Finally at midnight, turn the lights off. It's a pretty neat way to keep track of time when you don't have a clock nearby and you are hanging with company, etc. Definitely recommended! I plan on fitting all of my BR30 lights in the house to these. The color temperatures of the whites alone make it a great investment."

It responds quickly and accurately.
The price was also good in comparison to the others I looked at. As long as it doesn't fail or something, and continues working as it is now, I can recommend it without qualification, as long as you can handle not having Homekit.

First though, let me say how well it has worked in the hours that I've been using it. Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant are both controlling even better than I'd hoped. It dims easily by voice commands, via all the apps for Alexa, Google Home and Kasa, and of course using the physical buttons on the switch. I can dim it to pretty much any percentage that I want and, contrary to some of the answered questions I've seen, the switch remembers the last dimmer setting when it turns back on instead of full brightness.
Here's where I avoided giving it that 5th star. For the installation, the face plate came pre-assembled and was ridiculously difficult to remove in order to install the switch. After several minutes of struggling, it finally came off but only after it cracked the plastic upper piece where it attaches to the the body of the switch. Fortunately, it was not too damaged to properly install it and the crack was not visible since it is behind the face plate. Kasa people: it's great that the face plate fits so tightly once completely installed, but please don't pre-assemble it in the box if it is going to be such a challenge. Once installed the switch worked perfectly as a standalone unit, but then the setup via the Kasa app took a dozen or so attempts before the device could finally be discovered over Wifi. That was very aggravating. I've got both 2.4g and 5g networks and tried using one or the other to see if that was the issue but it didn't seem to make any difference. Additionally, this device is closer to my router than an existing Kasa non-dimmer smart switch and my phone was literally just inches away from the device, so those helpful hints on how to resolve it were not helping at all.
In the end, it was well worth the money and minimal trouble. I love that it does not require a hub like other products which I won't name and I'm happy that I chose this Kasa product instead. I only wish I'd bought two of them at the great price offered during Cyber Monday..."

So I decided to go ahead and change those bulbs over too. You get 3 bulbs with this which works out perfect for me since my ceiling fan takes 3 bulbs. It was easy to screw the new bulbs in, and easy to get it sync’d up with my Alexa and my app on my phone. It is easy to change the colors using the app, and not complicated or confusing at all. I like to be able to control the lights without the need to get up because sometimes you just don’t want to get up or move especially after a long or stressful day of working, you just want to sit or lay and relax. These bulbs make that possible. I like how you can pick from the different colors too, sometimes you might like a certain or different color depending on the mood you’re in."

The lights are controlled with the Smart Life app but can also be controlled with Google Home/Google Assistant.
To set the bulbs in ""program mode"", you need to connect the bulb to your light fixture and cycle the light switch off/on three times and then the light bulb should blink, indicating its ready to be synced with the Smart Life app. Do one bulb at a time and then add your bulbs to a light group in the app for simultaneous control.

I searched the internet for cheap candelabra smart bulbs, not wanting to pay the $40 for one Hue bulb ALONGSIDE the Hue bridge for an additional $30-$40. Finding a set of three smart light bulbs for $10 cheaper was like a dream come true, especially since I have 3 bulbs in my bedroom light. Why pay $40+ for 1 Hue light bulb when I can pay $30 for 3?
When I first received them in the mail I was honestly surprised how small they were. This isn't a bad thing, as I have small lights and they don't stick out awkwardly! I followed the instructions that were provided with my bulbs and installed the app on my phone. (Someone stated in a review that they did not get any instructions, so maybe they fall out of boxes?) What's really nice is that they don't need an Alexa or a Google Home to work and you can easily control them through the app, which is updated often so your bulbs will always be kept up to date! My only suggestion for the app is to add a Grouping feature so I can group my three bedroom lights and turn all three of them on at once or set them all to the same color without having to ask Alexa to change them to the basic colors she can recognize. I am planning to add at least one more bulb to my collection in another room, so having a feature that would allow me to control two separate rooms with multiple bulbs in them would be wonderful!
Both the yellow and white lights are pleasant to look at and the RGB colors are very crisp! The three light bulbs together are very bright, however my only complaint is that these light bulbs don't dim as much as I'd like them too. I can tell Alexa to dim them to 1% and they still seem oddly bright. This is not too much of an issue though, as when I do want them extremely dim, I just tell Alexa to turn the lights blue or red, but if you're looking for extremely dim light bulbs, these may not be the bulbs for you
Something fun I noticed is that both the blue and purple colors work as florescent black lights! I've been working on an art concentration consisting of neon colors, so having a light bulb I can adjust to become the perfect florescent black light is wonderful for me! :) Not necessarily a ""feature"" the average consumer would be looking for, but a very welcomed one!!
I will definitely be re-purchasing these light bulbs once they kick the bucket (not really sure when that will be as I only use these at night!) Thank you for making a very cheap and affordable smart light, I have been very impressed so far and I will definitely be back to do business with this company again :)"

These work perfectly right out of the box and very easy to setup. The 3 pack came with a nice step by step instruction sheet to setup the app to control the lights as well as instructions to sync with Alexa. You can control the lights individually or set them up as a group to all work together. There are some cool scenes and different options within the app as well. Very satisfied."

The character of Molly Morris/Brook Stonebridge (Miley Cyrus) greatly enjoys her job as a private investigator. Molly Morris professionally works alongside her father Sam Morris (Mike O’ Malley) and the movie shows how evident it is that they have a healthy and strong father and daughter connection. However, even Morris’s close connection with her father does not prepare her for an accidental meeting with Armon Ranford (Jeremy Priven). Armon Ranford is aware of Molly Morris’s talent and intends to recruit her for an important project involving a sorority consisting of multiple wealthy sorority females at a popular college somewhere in the American south. In order to conduct her mission discreetly, Molly Morris is encouraged to pose as an undercover student transferring from the University of Hawaii.

My biggest concern was that the app functionality may be lost by only using one of the WiFi 3-way switches. I can assure you that all app functions remain intact. I have split two sets of these TP-Link HS 210 switches and used individually on four completely separate 3- way switching circuits (one of them was actually a 4-way w/four switches controlling a set of lights.) I also have tested and verified full functionality w/ Alexa.
To do this setup just replace one of the 3-way switches in the circuit and do the app setup as usual. When prompted to do the setup on the 2nd switch in the circuit just keep pressing done ✅ as if you had followed the instructions. This will complete the setup and allow you to use the app to control your 3 or 4-way circuits just like any other TP-Link devices. Repeat the previous steps with the 2nd switch in the package and BOOM.... you are done. If having matching switches is more important to you than saving hundreds of dollars, please disregard this post. Good luck."

I have waited for these for quite some time now and bought a set the first day they became available. This is my 30th TP-Link smart switch/plug and they never disappoint!!
The HS210 3-way switch kit was very easy to install using the Kasa app. It walks you through the step by step installation all the way down to reminding you to take a picture of all labeled wires before you disconnect the old switches. Configuration to your Wifi network is a breeze, just like their standard single pole smart switch. Obviously, there are a few more steps involved given it sets up both switches within the same process, one at a time. I have lots of practice using their setup app so it only took 10 mins tops to compete.
I installed it in the same switch box together with a single pole TP Link switch and will say that it’s a challenge to get everything to fit. Extra wires along with the large backs on these things make for little room. I didn’t connect the ground wires to save some space, just cut it short and taped it off.
My only complaint is that the white circle light on the switch itself is dimmer than the standard switches so if you’re picky like me it doesn’t look uniform, especially if installed next to each other.
I’ll be purchasing these sets for the rest of my 3-ways. Definitely happy with the product!!
First picture attached is next to a single pole TP-Link and second is next to standard switch (not a smart switch)."

One thing I was concerned about when I was going to install them was that I was going to need to replace all of the 3-way switches with the HS210's. This isn't necessary!!! You can replace only one of the 3-way switches with a HS210 and receive all the benefits of a smart house! For example, you can replace one 3-way switch with a HS210 and leave the other switch alone. The Kasa app and Google Home or Alexa will be able to turn the light on and off. The other physical switch will still allow you to do the same. The Kasa app will update too when the old physical switch is toggled! I was amazed at how seamless it was!"

I previously installed the single pole and it's been working great, so I jumped on this 3-way version when I saw the price drop recently. My only wish is that it would work natively with Samsung Smartthings (now that I've also jumped into that pool). For now, I'm content with the Kasa app and controlling the lights through Google/Alexa.
The main reason I want to write this review is to provide another data point in the ""Do you have to install both switches"" question. Unfortunately, I DID have to install both switches. My circuit has two 3-way switches with two 4-way switches similar to SJ's review.
When I initially just installed one, the actual switch worked fine to toggle the lights on and off, but the switches and the app never knew the state of the lights. I figured this because the light on the switch was always on, which seems to indicate that it always thought the lights were off. More importantly, the app only toggled the lights on/off every other press. Basically, the lights would only respond (turn on or off) when the app thinks it's turning the lights on. If the app thinks it's turning the lights off, nothing happened. Finally, I could only toggle the lights on/off by telling Alexa to turn the lights on. Asked Alexa to turn the lights off did nothing.
Anyway, everything is working perfectly now that I'm using them as designed. Just wanted to provide more information for possible buyers."

It took me about 30 minutes to install.
The best part is that I only needed to install one of these on a circuit. So, I will use the other one on a different circuit.
Pros:
Instructions on mobile app are clear and easy to follow.
Works well with Alexa
Cons:
The switch only works in one position. It's not a rocker switch. Plus the tactile feeling is odd. It doesn't feel like a switch when you touch it.
It's ""beefy"". It takes up a lot of room. So, it's not easy to push it into the box when finished.
I am giving five stars because I intend to buy more!"

Works just as good as my Phillip's hue bulbs but at 1/4 the price! Setup was straight forward although it did take a couple of times to connect. Once connected operating with the app and alexa was simple and satisfying. Has good brightness and really nice colors. Construction is plastic and feels very solid. All in all I'm very impressed with these light bulbs. If you are trying to get into smart lighting I would definitely reccomend these lights as you get great performance at a very affordable price! I plan to use the colors to set the mood when hosting friends and family this fall and into the holidays."

Didn't buy it coz those were expensive. Came across this and thought to give a try to it since the price was in the right range for me. I would have to say that I'm impressed with it. These lights added a colorful character to my home. The setup was easy but would have to note that the LEDs only connect to 2.4 GHz wifi. It will not work with 5.0 GHz. Connecting to google home was also easy. I'm yet to give a shot for the voice commands. Sometimes, the change in the app takes some time to get reflected in the LED bulb, Say if you are changing the color, it takes some time to get reflected. This happened only for one of them that I purchased.
PROS:
1. Colors are bright and real.
2. Ability to control the brightness, saturation, and softness.
3. Clear Instructions.
CONS:
1. Only works with 2.4 GHZ wifi.
2. The scenes in the app are little vague."

Definitely worth paying a little extra for this one over the 2nd generation model. I'm not going to discuss the functionality as there's tons of info already out there. One important note: If you set up the Alexa app on your phone, IT WILL IMPORT ALL OF YOUR PHONE CONTACTS. I didn't think I gave it permission to do so but Alexa did indeed import my contacts! You may have read stories how, WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE, Alexa can record what's being said in your home and then send it to ANY or ALL of those contacts! Yikes! And, I won't want any of my kids to accidentally send messages to or call people on my contact list. So, if you want to keep your contacts from Alexa and prevent that from happening here's how I did it:
Before installiing the Alexa app on your phone, export your contacts to a file and save it for later. Then, go back to the phone and delete those contacts (don't worry, you'll import them back in later). Now, install the Alexa app on your phone and go through the set up process. At some point, you'll have the option to allow Alexa to automatically import any additions to your contacts. Please ""disable"" that option. After you're done with the installation, you'll notice there are no contacts in your Alexa app! Now, you can import your contacts back into your phonebook using the file that you initially created and you're good to go!
If you already installed the app but want to delete your contacts from Alexa, it's not too late. Simply export your phone contacts to a file and save for later. Then, delete the contacts from your phone. Now, open the Alexa app and click ""Contacts."" On the Contacts page, click on ""Import Contacts"" and enable it by moving the button to the right side. This will cause Alexa to replace your existing contacts with the now empty phonebook. After a few minutes, your Alexa contacts will be gone. Go back and disable ""Import Contacts"" to prevent Alexa from importing them in the future. You can now import the contact file that you created back into your phone.
Of course there may be some contacts you do want to use with Alexa. I simply added them manually by clicking ""Add Contact.""
I hope this info is helpful as I wasn't able to find an easy way to manage Alexa contacts."

I cannot say enough about this amazon echo dot. It is WONDERFUL. Loud, crisp, and knows my voice so well. I love the size of this one. It is much more convenient and easy to stow away but still be heard with the far field of sound. My guests have absolutely enjoyed asking questions and about the weather and especially using it with my Spotify. I purchased a wall mount too that works very well. Again I would recommend this to anyone who loves to have music around the house being played. Did I mention the price? Unbeatable. Don’t get a knock off! Just get the amazon echo dot 3rd generation and do yourself a favor. I am just over the moon about this item. Thanks amazon!
EDIT - After two months using I am so satisfied with my proud bird wall mount! It fits my echo dot perfectly! I have already bought another!"

I love my echo dot. I have four of them and they really help make my life easier. They can control almost everything, lights, locks TV, music, thermostat. It hears you almost all of the time and I've run into very few issues with it overall. I really couldn't ask for a more helpful device. It's even more handy when I found that I could get a battery base for it. The GGMM D3 base that I found lets me carry the alexa dot around pretty much anywhere. I love that I can take it into the bathroom with me and listen to music while I shower or take it outside and listen to music. That's really the only thing I think it was missing."

It has proven to be so useful in so many other ways, I immediately ordered 2 more bulbs after setting up my first bulb.
• Incredibly easy setup, just screw it into your lamp, download the app, and then follow the guided instructions on the app.
• The app is very straightforward and easy to use. It has so many features that allow to you control the atmosphere of your room without leaving the comfort of your seat.
**It also saves the last settings you set before closing the app on your phone, so you don’t have to keep the app open all the time to use the bulbs!
• Sunrise/Sunset timer - much more afforable than a $100 sunrise alarm clock, you can set multiple alarms with different settings (brightness/intervals/days of the week) which is a setting that most of the alarm clocks don’t have, and since it’s silent, you can have your own alarms on your phone to make noise or just wake up naturally without an alarm sound.
•Turning on lights remotely - I live in an apartment where there are minimal ceiling lights and none of the switches for them are near entrances, so being able to turn lights on before coming home makes it so much more convenient without stumbling in the dark. This is also helpful if it starts to get darker earlier in the winter before you get home and you want to provide some light for your pets while you’re not home.
• Affordable alternative to lamp timers to deter home intruders when you’re not home.
• Mood lighting - using this with lower brightness and a soft colored glow definitely helps you to relax and start to get tired before bed. You can sit in bed and adjust the settings without hassle.
I’m definitely never buying a regular lightbulb again after experiencing the convenience of these bulbs. I would definitely love to replace all the bulbs in my home with these and highly recommended them to everyone."

For one, I think the setup procedures in these smart device apps are over-simplified, and don't really give as much info as is necessary. Maybe if your phone and router are miraculously already set up exactly as needed it would be great. But, it's really necessary to tweak a lot of settings to make this work. But, once you hit the magic combo, it falls right in line. I just wish I knew which combo actually did the trick. All of that said, the amount of customization, automation and convenience is pretty impressive. It's nice that an additional hardware hub isn't necessary with these, especially for the price. I am currently running 2 of these, and 2 wemo mini outlets through Google Home/Assistant on my Pixel 2 XL, while I await my Home Hub. Now if I can just get my very reluctant girlfriend used to talking to Google (she hates it).
EDIT.: 1/3/19 - I now have 8 of these in my house. In conjunction with Google Home Hub I can turn these on or off individually, or in groups, and after I crawl into bed all at once. I really like them, and they have the added fun of whole-house light show if I wish. As others have mentioned though, they could be a tad brighter."

I can even change up the schedule according to the day of the week. Seeing as how it is one of the only lights I have in that particular room so it would be nice to be a bit brighter, but would say it's plenty bright for a 40W bulb. I'm purchasing the 50W as well to see if that helps."

The brightness was what I was expecting; that said that isn't really why I purchased the light, it was the color and the control. The app is good, and very usable as is, but like most pieces of software, everyone has a feature or opinion about the details. You have good and consistent calendar control, along with sunrise/sunset controls. You have custom color controls as well.
The few rubs I have: a 10 bit addressing scheme would take this to another level for subtle color control. It would be great if there was stronger group controls, one simple enhancement would be a way to share a color pallet and timing schemes with a number of identical lights (make a batch easily). Lastly, a better way to use the lights to emulate time rather than simply mark it. For instance, I had an application for at least one of these lights to come on and reinforce sunset colors as they are happening and even sunrise for the same reason."

I would highly recommend this bulb. The set up is easy, if you follow the directions. Once set-up, you can control it with your Google home, you can set it to wake you with a slowly brightening light each morning. So much better than an annoying alarm.
Here is the best part, it is half to a third the price of the other color changing light bulbs.
The support from the manufacture is great. Ryan Schultze, the founder of MagicLight, follows up quickly, with answers and instructions that are clear and easy to understand.
Check out my video of the light working."

It was bittersweet for me to replace it with the newer 3rd Gen but they had an amazing trade-in offer so I had to take advantage of it. First thing to note this Echo is much shorter than Gen 1 but a little wider which I prefer because it looks and fits better on my kitchen island. The new blue color is amazing if you’re considering getting it! Setting up the new Echo was the easiest most seamless process! I literally took it out of the box, plugged it in and in under a minute it set itself up and was ready to use! I didn’t have to do anything, it was already programmed with my smart lights and my WiFi, couldn’t ask for an easier setup. I love my Echo and use it every day and if you’re considering getting one, I say go for it! If I had to critique or complain about anything the only thing I could say is the wall adapter is really large since it’s still a square block like Gen 1. This is more of a personal opinion but Gen 1 had a rotating top to turn the volume up and down (which I loved) where as Gen 3 has volume up and down buttons. Functionally they both work I just though the rotating volume top was more fun and unique, but I’ll live on just fine with the buttons."

What a waste of money. They're basic; real basic. My fault for not truly understanding what I was buying. It can answer some simple questions with simple answers and do a few smart home things and has ""skills"" but that's about it. Isn't that enough? No, it isn't. I guess I thought I was getting something smart, something I could engage with, seek intelligent replies from, something connected to the world wide web of knowledge. Guess I was wrong. I got a stupid little automated squawk box; a borderline parrot. Guess I got bought. For all our great advances in technology, we're clearly still in our technological infancy. Get back to me when I can say ""Computer, describe to me quantum physics in layman's terms. Explain to me the theory of relativity. What exactly is gravity; are there gravity particles? What is the meaning of life?"" The answer to the latter better be: 42. Another big gripe is that it's constantly trying to sell me something -running through a whole dales pitch -instead of just doing or playing what I asked, or it tells me what it's about to do even though I just asked it exactly that. Now I know why it's called, Echo. I'll be getting rid of it soon. Anybody wanna buy a stupid, smart device?"

We purchased 2 of the generation 3 Echos and an Amazon sub as a package (saved $80 + an additional $60 for taking the Amazon store card) to replace the Bose speaker / Echo Dot we had.
We now have room filling sound as good as the Bose combo without having to physically turn on the speaker every time we wanted music.
Even without the sub, the sound is robust and rich from each of the linked speakers. The addition of the powered Echo sub fills in the lows to make it an immersive experience.
Setup was fairly easy. My only complaint was that I had trouble renaming the 2nd Echo itself. Amazon keeps calling it another wacky name. Overall, it took less than 5 minutes to link all 3 speakers together and be listening.
Would I purchase again? You can count on it."

I researched quite a bit for a light strip system that would handle 75 ft. All pretty much was going to need to be soldered with a 12V 5a power source and a injection needed and additional power source. Most systems could only handle 32ft before needing another power source. Then a controller was needed to integrate with Echo or wifi or ST. Was getting costly for the amount of work. I then came across this system and I thought what gives?? 24v 4a system, the math works out for the 65ft. Reviews were hit or miss, but most had to do with issues out of the box. This system had everything I needed except integration with Smartthings, but I can get around that with the Alexa Enabled Magic Home Skill and Wifi controller through IFTTT.
The set up was a breeze, and runs in Parallel. If you want to run them in series you will need to get a male 4 prong RGB connector since both ends of the lights have female connector attachments on them. I needed an additional 10 ft, so I opted with purchasing 2 systems and cutting one of them to extend the additional 10 ft. I was able to use a solderless connector to connect the two strips. There is no issue with brightness loss from the extension.
The adhesive tape on the back is Great!! Easy to place and strong hold. The remote is limited, but the Magic Home app is decent with great color scales. Lights sync up to music from the speaker of your phone through the app, but I have not explored this use much. There might be a way to use music through Echo. Last.....These lights are BRIGHT!! I run them at 30% Dim and they are bright enough. At 100% they are great!. This is a great system for the price, especially for long runs and distances.
Only two down sides: 1) Remote is limited (but not needed) 2) Connectors are not very tight and come apart easily (Lights to Wifi controller to Power supply) are the weak connections. Tape or zip ties can solve this issue."

So after almost a month it has been doing well but the lights change on there own and it is creepy. I like to keep the lights on the color white because it makes my room look nice and clean but when I am laying in bed the lights will change color without me touching the remote.
P.S. the first picture is what the lights changed to and the second is the white."

They're super bright, and I love that I can make them any color I want. They're fairly easy to install, and they're easy to sync up to the app/with Alexa. Two things to note about installation: For one, don't skip the step about cleaning the surface first. I made that mistake, and they didn't adhere very well. They're also fairly fragile. I dropped the roll and a portion of the lights bent at weird angle and caused about 5 LEDs to go out. It was my fault, not a problem with the product, but make sure to handle them in a way that they don't get bent."
